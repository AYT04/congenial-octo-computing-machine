### *YouTube Filter Blocker — because sometimes you just want peace.*

## 🚀 What Even Is This
This Chrome extension is basically digital noise‑cancelling headphones for YouTube.  
It yeets away the clutter, the cringe, the “recommended for you” that you *never* asked for, and the sidebar that keeps trying to drag you into a 3‑hour iceberg video at 2AM.

If YouTube is the chaotic friend who won’t stop oversharing, this extension is the friend who gently puts a hand on their shoulder and says:  
“Bestie… stop.”

## ✨ Features (aka: Things It Bullies Into Disappearing)
- Sidebars? Gone.  
- Recommended shelves? Deleted from existence.  
- Guide sections? Vanished like your motivation on a Monday.  
- YouTube Music clutter? *Silenced.*  
- Random profile images? Poof.  
- Basically anything that tries to distract you from the one video you actually came to watch.

## 🛠️ Installation (It’s Giving ‘Tech Wizard’)
1. Download or clone this chaotic masterpiece.  
2. Open Chrome → type `chrome://extensions` like a hacker.  
3. Turn on **Developer Mode** (top right — you’ll feel powerful).  
4. Click **Load unpacked**.  
5. Select the folder.  
6. Boom. You’re now the CEO of Focus™.

## 🧠 How It Works (The Nerdy Bit)
It injects CSS into YouTube pages and tells certain elements to sit down, be quiet, and stop bothering you.  
No JavaScript shenanigans. No tracking. No data harvesting.  
Just pure, wholesome “leave me alone” energy.

If you break something… also open a PR.  
We’re all just winging it anyway.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Use responsibly.

## 🧋 Final Thoughts
YouTube is great, but sometimes it needs boundaries.  
This extension is those boundaries.  
Go forth, watch your one video, and escape before the algorithm seduces you again.
